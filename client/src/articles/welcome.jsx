    text: `Congratulations, young hero! You've bravely faced the challenge of diabetes type 1 and emerged victorious from your hospital stay. Now, it's time to embark on a new adventure as you return to school. This journey may seem daunting, but with the right knowledge and mindset, you'll thrive and inspire those around you.
    1. Be Your Own Diabetes Champion: As you step back into the school corridors, remember that you are now a diabetes champion, and knowledge is your superpower. Educate your teachers, classmates, and friends about your condition. You can hold a brief presentation or show them a fun video explaining diabetes type 1, its management, and any special needs you might have. Be proud of your journey and use it as an opportunity to raise awareness and spread understanding.
    2. Team Up with Your Support Crew: Your parents, teachers, and school staff are your support crew - they are there to help you succeed. Collaborate with them to create a diabetes management plan that fits into your daily routine. This plan should include meal schedules, insulin administration (if needed), blood glucose monitoring times, and any other personalized care requirements. Working together will ensure you have the necessary support while maintaining your independence.
    3. The Super Snack Box: Your school day will be full of excitement and learning, and you'll need a trusty sidekick - your Super Snack Box! Pack it with healthy snacks like fruits, nuts, whole-grain crackers, or veggies that will keep your energy levels steady. Remember, you're a superhero, and you need the right fuel to keep your powers strong.
    4. The Lunchtime Quest: Lunchtime may seem like an epic quest, but with a little planning, it'll be a breeze. Coordinate with the school cafeteria staff to ensure there are suitable options for you. Bring your own lunch if needed, and make sure your friends know how to recognize the signs of low or high blood sugar, so they can alert an adult if you need assistance.
    5. Carb Counting Magic: You have the power of carb counting in your arsenal - a super skill that will help you manage your blood sugar levels effectively. Work with your parents or healthcare provider to understand the carbohydrate content of different foods. This skill will come in handy when you want to enjoy treats or participate in birthday celebrations with your classmates.
    6. Invisible CGM Shield: Your Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) device is like an invisible shield, always keeping an eye on your blood sugar levels. Embrace this technology, as it will allow you and your support crew to monitor your glucose trends discreetly throughout the school day. It's a valuable tool in your fight against diabetes.
    7. Rise Above Challenges: Some days might feel tough, and that's okay - even superheroes face challenges. Remember that your diabetes doesn't define you; it's just one part of your incredible story. Reach out to friends or a school counselor if you ever need to talk or seek encouragement. Together, you'll conquer any obstacle that comes your way.
    As you return to school with your head held high, know that you are a remarkable hero, capable of achieving anything you set your mind to. Embrace the love and support around you, and never forget that you have the strength to manage your diabetes and inspire others to do the same. You are a true champion, and this new chapter is bound to be filled with extraordinary adventures!`,
